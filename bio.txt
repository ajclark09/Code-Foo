My name is Andrew Clark. I am 20 years old and I live in Texas, working on a degree from Blinn. As far as past work experience related to the tech industry, I worked on my high school's art database my senior year. Having only taken classes in Java, I was pretty much thrust into this job and forced to learn what I had to myself. I always regret not having a proper education in web development, as I just taught myself what I needed to know to get the job done, never actually learning the complete fundamentals like I did with Java. In the meantime I had a job as a lifeguard for 3 years; something to bring me money while I focused on school. I would love to take web development classes at my school, but the tech program is practically non-existent. This would be a great opportunity for me to really learn about the industry and about web development.
